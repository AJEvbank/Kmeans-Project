Running: To run type ./source .

Command Line Arguments:
1: dim, default dim = 128
2: ndata, default ndata = 10000
3: maximum size of data point Values, default max_double = 1000.00
4: number of clusters, default k = 128
5: seed multiplier (any positive non-zero integer), default seedMult = 1
   //This is a multiplier for the seed array { 1, 2, 3, 4 }.

Note: Command line arguments cannot be skipped.

Frank Ibem's clusters.py can be used. The program will create the file
data.txt iff dim = 2. If this file has been created, then run clusters.py
(included) in the program directory to view a png of the kmeans and its
cluster assignments.
